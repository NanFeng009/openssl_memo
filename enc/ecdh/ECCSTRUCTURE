Domain parameters:
The prime <p> that specifies the size of the finite field.
The coefficients <a> and <b> of the elliptic curve equation.
The base point <G> that generates our subgroup.
The order <n> of the subgroup.
The cofactor <h> of the subgroup.
In conclusion, the domain parameters for our algorithms are the sextuple <p,a,b,G,n,h>.
